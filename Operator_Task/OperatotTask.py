# What is the differences between = , == ?
# = assigns values (DE zuweisungsoperator)
# == Comparison Operators : check if the value of two operands is equal or not , if yes then it is True
# (4 == 5) = False

# What do we mean by using != ?
# check if the value of two operands is not equal , if not then it is True
# (4 != 5) = True

# What is the operator precedence?
# This is the situation where we use the precedence of the operators, to get the correct result.
# EX : (4+2**2)/2+(4*3+6/2) = (8)/2+(15) = 19

# Create a variable x with value of 10
x = 10
# Increase x value by 15 using assignment operators
x += 5
print(x)                                # 15
# Divide the x value by 5 using assignment operators
x /= 5
print(x)                                # 3.0
# Multiply the x value by 10 using assignment operator
x *= 10
print(x)                                # 30.0
# Get module of x on 3 using assignment operators
x /= 3
print(x)                                # 10.0

# Using python print the module of 11 to 4:
print(11 % 4)                           # 3
# Print the exponent of 2,3:
print(2**3)                             # 8
# Divide 11 by 3 using python division
print(11/3)                             # 3.6666666666666665
# Can we divide 11 by 3 and get an integer number ?
print(11//3)                            # 3 oder using int-function in print-function print(int(11/3))
